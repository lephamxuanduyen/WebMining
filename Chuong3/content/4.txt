      The United Auto Workers union is expanding its strike to additional facilities of automakers Ford and GM. The UAW did not call for additional Stellantis members to go on strike.
  

  
      UAW President Shawn Fain said that Ford and GM have not made enough progress in meeting union demands, despite a strike that has gone on for 15 days. He called for the strike expansion to turn up the pressure at the bargaining table.
  

  
      While the union has been on strike against all three unionized automakers for the first time in its history, the UAW started the walkouts on September 15 with a targeted work stoppage by 12,700 members at one assembly plant for each company. 
  

  
      A week ago it added a series of 38 parts and distribution centers operated in 20 states by GM and Stellantis but did not expand the strike at Ford, saying that automaker had made significant progress in negotiations.
